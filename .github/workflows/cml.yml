    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Python environment
      - name: Install Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      # Step 3: Set up CML (Continuous Machine Learning)
      # CML provides tools to generate reports and visualizations
      - name: Setup CML
        uses: iterative/setup-cml@v2

      # Step 4: Install project dependencies
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 5: Run the training and evaluation script
      - name: Train Model and Generate Metrics
        run: |
          python train_and_evaluate.py

      # Step 6: Create and publish CML report
      # This creates a visual report that gets posted as a comment on GitHub
